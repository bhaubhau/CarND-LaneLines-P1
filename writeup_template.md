**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of below steps: 
1. I converted the images to grayscale
2. I used canny function to detect th edges in the above gray scale image
3. I masked above image with a quadrilateral region of interest, and the found out the hough lines in the image by varying the parameters so as to detect proper lines which are surronding the lane
4. I extrapolated the hough lines found out by using np.polyfit for each hough line, and then partitioned the sets of the lines into left lane line and right lane line depending on the slope
5. I took the averages of slopes and coefficients for the left and right lines and fitted a lines between top and bottom of region of interest quadrilateral
6. I superimposed the above extrapolated lines over the original image to get the annotated image
7. Above steps were implemented into a function, and then by iterating over the images in input folder, the output images were generated by applying this function
8. To generate the video output, I applied the above function to the input video using moviepy library which outputted the annotated set of frames to output video file

To get the outputs, please run the P1.ipynb in the workspace, and check the output folders

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

1. There is lot of flicker happening when we approach near to a curve
2. If the ROI and parameters of hough lines calculations are not correct, the lane lines present in adjacent lanes also get captured
3. It can be challenging to identify the accurate lane lines where road becomes narrower resulting in lane crossings
4. other things like speed brakers, zebra crossings, road juctions can also become problems


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

1. A possible improvement would be to add logic to handle curves
2. Logic for extrapolation can be improved by using advanced python syntax and functions provided by the libraries
